NOTE: you may notice my github looking a bit empty ðŸ‘€. I've recently cleaned up and deleted a lot of the old repos that I used to work on, im currently building a portfolio to better host my work as well as my blog (programming related). If you're interested in my code style take a look at the code in my portfolio repo https://github.com/Nevnet99/Portfolio, more will be coming soon!
